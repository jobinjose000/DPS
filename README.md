# Disease Prediction System (DPS)

A simple web-based **Disease Prediction System** that allows users to input symptoms and receive predictions about possible diseases. This project was developed using **PHP**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to provide an interactive user interface and backend logic for disease prediction.

The **KNN algorithm** is used to predict the possible diseases based on the input symptoms by comparing the userâ€™s data with a dataset of known symptoms and diseases. The system selects the "K" nearest points (symptom matches) and outputs the most common disease among those points.

## Features
- User-friendly interface to input symptoms.
- Predicts diseases based on input symptoms using backend logic.
- Responsive design for ease of use on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
